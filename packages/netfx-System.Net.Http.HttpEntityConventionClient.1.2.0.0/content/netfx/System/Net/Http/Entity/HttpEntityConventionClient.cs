	/// A client API that communicates with REST services implemented 
	/// using standard REST methods and WCF Web API for querying.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// The API assumes that entities have an ID that can be rendered 
	/// as a string (Uris are strings ;)), and that POST is performed 
	/// to the entity resource parent (not the entity Uri, like "products/23", 
	/// but "products") and it's used for creating the entity. 
	/// <para>
	/// PUT can be used also for entity creation when the client 
	/// determines the server-side URI (i.e. it generates a GUID).
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// Of course the service needs to implement this same style of REST 
	/// service, but this is extremely common.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// Select expressions in the query cause it to be executed and 
	/// materialized locally, so that further operations can be 
	/// performed even if they are in the 
	/// <see cref="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee622463.aspx#unsupportedMethods">unsupported methods</see> 
	/// list. If anything fails in the expression, you can always call 
	/// ToList and use Linq to Objects from that point on. This is 
	/// automatic after a Select.
